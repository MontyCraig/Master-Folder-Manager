5. Status reporting

### Directory Operations


1. Structure analysis
2. Content categorization
3. Bulk operations
4. Progress tracking

### Drive Operations


1. Volume discovery
2. Space analysis
3. Tree building
4. Status monitoring

## Performance Considerations

* Lazy loading for large directories
* Progress tracking for long operations
* Memory efficient tree building
* Caching for frequent operations
