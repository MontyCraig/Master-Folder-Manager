## 1. Core Principles

- **Pythonic, Readable Code:**  
  Prefer clarity over cleverness. Use idiomatic Python constructs (list comprehensions, context managers) judiciously.
  
- **Strong Typing & Type Checking:**  
  Adopt type hints everywhere. Run `mypy` or `pyright` to catch type-related issues early.
  
- **Data Validation & Pydantic Models:**  
  Represent external data (API requests, configs) with Pydantic models for automatic validation, parsing, and type safety.
  
- **Security & Input Sanitization:**  
  Validate and sanitize all user input. Consider any external input (CLI args, HTTP requests, file input) as untrusted until validated.
  
- **Documentation & Version Control:**  
  Keep code documented with docstrings and maintain a project `README.md`. All code changes go through Git with meaningful commit messages.
  
- **Performance & Scalability:**  
  Keep complexity low, profile code when performance matters, and design architectures that scale horizontally if needed.

---

## 2. Project Structure & Architecture

- **Modular, Layered Architecture:**  
  Separate code into logical layers: `domain`, `services`, `adapters`, `infrastructure`. Avoid monolithic, tightly coupled code.
  
- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  Separate business logic from I/O and framework-specific code. Let domain logic remain pure and testable.
  
- **Dependency Injection & Inversion of Control:**  
  Pass dependencies as parameters. Avoid global singletons. Use factories or frameworks like `injector` if beneficial.
  
- **Config Management & Environment Variables:**  
  Store secrets and environment-specific settings outside the codebase. Use `.env` files or secret managers. Load configuration through Pydantic models for consistency.
  
- **Packaging & Distribution:**  
  Use `setup.py`, `pyproject.toml`, or `poetry` for packaging. Keep dependencies in `requirements.txt` or `poetry.lock`. Tag releases and follow semantic versioning.

---

## 3. Coding Standards & Style

- **PEP 8 Compliance:**  
  Adhere strictly to PEP 8 for formatting, naming, and spacing. Use linters (Flake8) and formatters (Black) to automate.
  
- **Naming Conventions & Clear Abstractions:**  
  Name variables, functions, and classes descriptively. Avoid single-letter names except in short, localized contexts.
  
- **Inline Comments & Docstrings:**  
  Add docstrings to all functions, methods, classes, and modules. Explain the "why" behind complex logic.
  
- **Black, isort, and Flake8 Integration:**  
  Apply Black for consistent formatting, isort for orderly imports, and Flake8 for linting. Run these in CI to enforce standards.
  
- **Strict MyPy Type Checking:**  
  Use `mypy` in strict mode. Treat type errors as build failures to maintain strong typing guarantees.

---

## 4. Typing & Data Modeling

- **Type Hints & Annotations:**  
  Annotate all parameters, return values, and class attributes. This clarifies contracts and aids tooling.
  
- **Pydantic for Validation & Parsing:**  
  Use Pydantic `BaseModel` classes for request/response bodies, configuration files, and domain entities. Enforce strict fields, `con*` types for constraints.
  
- **Typed Dictionaries & Protocols:**  
  Use `TypedDict` for well-defined dictionaries. Use `Protocol` interfaces to define expected behaviors and enable duck typing with type safety.
  
- **Enums & Constants for Domain-Specific Types:**  
  Define Enums for known sets of choices. Keep constants and magic numbers in a dedicated constants module.
  
- **JSON Serialization & Deserialization:**  
  Leverage Pydantic's `.dict()` and `.json()` methods for serialization. For custom JSON handling, write dedicated encoder/decoder functions.

---

## 5. Error Handling & Logging

- **Exceptions vs Return Codes:**  
  Use exceptions to signal error conditions. Create custom exception classes for domain-specific errors.
  
- **Granular Custom Exceptions:**  
  Differentiate between recoverable and unrecoverable errors. Offer meaningful error messages for debugging.
  
- **Python's Logging Module & Structured Logging:**  
  Use the standard `logging` module. Adopt structured logging (e.g., JSON logs) for better observability in production.
  
- **Centralized Error Handling Strategies:**  
  For web frameworks, implement global exception handlers. Log stack traces, but sanitize sensitive data.
  
- **Auditing & Traceability:**  
  Correlate logs and errors with request IDs or correlation IDs. Make it easy to trace user actions and system events.

---

## 6. Input Validation & Security

- **Sanitizing User Input:**  
  Always validate data coming from forms, HTTP requests, or command-line arguments. Reject invalid data early.
  
- **Using Pydantic for Strict Validation:**  
  Define strict types (e.g., `conint(gt=0)`) for integers, regex fields for strings, and custom validators for complex logic.
  
- **Avoiding Injection Vulnerabilities:**  
  Escape or parameterize queries in SQL. Validate file paths. Avoid directly executing untrusted input.
  
- **Handling Credentials & Secrets Safely:**  
  Store secrets (API keys, DB passwords) in environment variables or a vault. Do not commit secrets to version control.
  
- **Security Audits & Dependency Scanning:**  
  Regularly run `pip-audit` or `safety` to detect vulnerable dependencies. Apply security patches promptly.

---

## 7. Performance & Scalability

- **Profiling & Benchmarking:**  
  Use `cProfile`, `py-spy`, or `line_profiler` to find bottlenecks. Optimize hot paths carefully.
  
- **AsyncIO & Concurrency:**  
  For I/O-bound tasks, use async/await. Consider frameworks like `asyncio`, `trio`, or `aiohttp`. Use multiprocessing for CPU-bound workloads.
  
- **Multiprocessing vs Multithreading:**  
  Know the difference. The GIL affects CPU-bound code. Use `multiprocessing` or C extensions for true parallelism.
  
- **Caching Strategies:**  
  Cache repetitive computations. Use Redis or in-memory caches. Invalidate caches thoughtfully.
  
- **Memory & Resource Management:**  
  Monitor memory usage. Consider async context managers and generators for large datasets. Use `contextlib` tools for clean resource management.

---

## 8. Testing & Quality Assurance

- **Unit, Integration, and End-to-End Tests:**  
  Test each layer in isolation. Use integration tests for database or network interactions, and E2E tests for full workflows.
  
- **pytest & Hypothesis:**  
  Write tests with `pytest`. Use `hypothesis` for property-based tests to discover edge cases automatically.
  
- **Mocks, Fakes, and Dependency Injection:**  
  Use `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock` to isolate components. Provide test doubles for external services.
  
- **Code Coverage Targets & Continuous Integration (CI):**  
  Aim for high coverage. Run tests in CI pipelines, fail builds on test failures. Track coverage trends over time.
  
- **Static Analysis & Security Scanning Tools:**  
  Employ `pylint` or `bandit` to detect code smells and security issues. Integrate these checks into CI/CD.

---

## 9. Documentation & Tooling

- **Docstrings & Sphinx/ MkDocs:**  
  Write thorough docstrings. Generate API docs with Sphinx or MkDocs. Keep them updated and versioned.
  
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):**  
  Document major technical decisions. Store ADRs in the repo. This ensures knowledge sharing and historical context.
  
- **README.md & CONTRIBUTING.md:**  
  Explain how to install, run, test, and contribute to the project. Outline coding standards and branching strategies.
  
- **Pre-commit Hooks & Git Hooks:**  
  Use pre-commit hooks to run linters, formatters, and type checkers before pushing code.
  
- **CI/CD Integration:**  
  Automate builds, tests, and deployments. Use GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar services to ensure consistency and reliability.

---

## 10. Internationalization & Localization

- **i18n & L10n Strategies:**  
  Use `gettext` or Babel to mark strings for translation. Keep translations updated for supported locales.
  
- **Storing & Handling Locale-Specific Data:**  
  Keep locale files external or in dedicated directories. Load translations at runtime.
  
- **Date, Time, and Currency Formatting:**  
  Use `babel` or `pendulum` for locale-aware date, time, and currency formatting.
  
- **Unicode & Character Encoding:**  
  Always use UTF-8. Test for characters outside ASCII to avoid encoding errors.

---

## 11. Future-Proofing & Maintenance

- **Regular Dependency Updates & Pinning Versions:**  
  Pin dependencies in `requirements.txt` or `poetry.lock`. Update regularly to avoid rot.
  
- **Upgrading to New Python Versions & Features:**  
  Track Python's release schedule. Adopt new language features (e.g., pattern matching) when stable and beneficial.
  
- **Modular Monorepos & Microservices Architecture:**  
  If scaling demands, break your project into microservices. Maintain consistent coding standards across services.
  
- **Continuous Refactoring & Code Reviews:**  
  Allocate time each sprint for refactoring. Conduct regular code reviews to maintain quality.
  
- **Knowledge Sharing & Training:**  
  Host internal workshops, maintain wikis, and keep the team informed of best practices and new tools.
