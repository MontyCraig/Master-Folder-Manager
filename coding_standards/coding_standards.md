  * `homebrew` for installing system-level dependencies
* **Additional Tools**:
  * `npm` for JavaScript package management
  * `conda` for isolated Python environments when necessary
  * `docker` for containerization
* **Frameworks Available**:
  * **Backend**: `Flask`, `Django`, `FastAPI`
  * **Frontend**: `React`, `Vue.js`, `Angular`


## **4. Project Structure**

* **Top-Level Directory**:
  * Named after the project.
  * Contains high-level documentation (`README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md`).
* **Subdirectories**:
  * `src/`: Main source code.
  * `tests/`: Test suites.
  * `docs/`: Detailed documentation.
  * `config/`: Configuration files.
  * `scripts/`: Utility scripts for setup, deployment, etc.
* **File Organization**:
  * Before creating new files or folders, verify if they already exist.
  * Follow the established directory tree.
* **Configuration Management**:
  * Use central configuration files (`config.py`, `.env`).
  * Avoid hard-coded paths; use dynamic paths relative to the project directory.
  * Store secrets securely using environment variables or secret management tools.


## **5. Coding Guidelines**

### **Programming Languages**

* **Primary Language**: Python (default for new projects unless specified).
* **Others**: JavaScript, CSS, HTML, C, C++.

### **Code Style**

* Follow **PEP 8** guidelines for Python code.
* Use **strong typing** with type hints and annotations (PEP 484).
* Keep lines under 79 characters.
* Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs).
* **Pydantic** is standard for data validation and settings management.

### **Naming Conventions**

* **Variables**: lowercase_with_underscores
* **Functions**: lowercase_with_underscores
* **Classes**: CapitalizedWords
* **Constants**: UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES
* **Modules and Packages**: lowercase_with_underscores

### **Formatting and Linting**

* Use automated tools:
  * **Formatter**: `black`
  * **Linter**: `flake8`, `pylint`
* Run linters and formatters before committing code.

### **Comments and Documentation**

* Write **docstrings** for all modules, classes, functions, and methods.
* Use triple quotes `"""` for docstrings.
* Follow **PEP 257** for docstring conventions.
* Add inline comments sparingly to explain complex logic.
* Keep comments up-to-date with code changes.


## **6. Error Handling and Logging**

* **Error Handling**:
  * Use `try-except` blocks to handle exceptions.
  * Catch specific exceptions rather than using a bare `except`.
  * Always clean up resources (files, connections) in a `finally` block if necessary.
* **Logging**:
  * Use the built-in `logging` module.
  * Configure logging at the application entry point.
  * Include log messages for:
    * Function entry and exit points.
    * Errors and exceptions.
    * Important state changes.
  * Use appropriate log levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`).


## **7. Input Validation and Sanitization**

* **Validation**:
  * Validate all external inputs (user inputs, API requests).
  * Use **Pydantic** models to enforce data types and constraints.
* **Sanitization**:
  * Sanitize inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities like injection attacks.
  * Use parameterized queries when interacting with databases.
  * Escape or remove harmful characters in inputs.


## **8. Modularity and Code Organization**

* **Module Size**:
  * Keep modules between **50 to 300 lines**.
  * If a module exceeds this limit, consider refactoring.
* **Functions and Classes**:
  * Functions should perform a single, well-defined task.
  * Classes should follow the Single Responsibility Principle.
* **Reusability**:
  * Identify reusable code and abstract it into utility modules.
  * Avoid code duplication.
* **Imports**:
  * Organize imports into three sections: standard library, third-party, local modules.
  * Remove unused imports.
  * Use absolute imports over relative imports.


## **9. Testing and Quality Assurance**

* **Unit Testing**:
  * Write tests for all functions and methods.
  * Use `unittest` or `pytest`.
* **Integration Testing**:
  * Test interactions between different components.
* **Test Coverage**:
  * Aim for at least **80%** code coverage.
  * Use tools like `coverage.py` to measure.
* **Continuous Integration**:
  * Set up CI pipelines to automate testing.
  * Use services like GitHub Actions or Jenkins.


## **10. Version Control Practices**

* **Git Usage**:
  * Initiate a new repository for each project.
  * Before starting, check for existing repositories.
* **Branching Strategy**:
  * Use `main` for stable code ready for release.
  * Create feature branches for new work.
  * Merge changes through Pull Requests.
* **Commit Messages**:
  * Use clear, descriptive messages.
  * Follow the convention:

    ```
    [Type] Short description (Fixes #issue_number)
    
    Detailed description of the changes.
    ```
  * Types include `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.
* **Ignoring Files**:
  * Use `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files.
  * Regularly update `.gitignore` as needed.


## **11. Dependency Management**

* **Virtual Environments**:
  * Use `venv` or `conda` for Python projects.
* **Requirements**:
  * Maintain `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile`.
  * Pin versions to avoid compatibility issues.
* **Regular Updates**:
  * Update dependencies regularly.
  * Check for security patches and deprecations.


## **12. Security Practices**

* **Secret Management**:
  * Do not commit secrets or credentials to version control.
  * Use environment variables or secret management tools.
* **Secure Coding**:
  * Follow best practices to prevent common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
* **Dependency Auditing**:
  * Use tools like `pip-audit` to identify vulnerable packages.
* **Access Control**:
  * Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.


## **13. Performance Optimization**

* **Efficient Code**:
  * Write code that is efficient in terms of time and space complexity.
* **Profiling**:
  * Use profiling tools (`cProfile`, `PyInstrument`) to identify bottlenecks.
* **Asynchronous Programming**:
  * Use `asyncio` for IO-bound tasks when appropriate.
