# Pydantic v2 Upgrade Status

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of upgrading the Master Folder Manager codebase to be fully compatible with Pydantic v2. The upgrade improves validation performance and future-proofs the codebase.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated all models to use ConfigDict instead of Config inner class
- [x] Replaced validator decorators with field_validator
- [x] Fixed handling of nested FileOperation objects
- [x] Updated tests to work with new validation error formats
- [x] Modified string comparison assertions in tests to handle Path objects
- [x] Fixed the operation_handler decorator to avoid nested model validation issues
- [x] Updated documentation to reflect Pydantic v2 requirements and changes

## Key Changes Made

### FileOperation Handling
We identified and fixed an issue with the operation_handler decorator that was causing validation errors when FileOperation objects were nested within other FileOperation objects:

```python
def operation_handler(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs) -> FileOperation:
        try:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            # Check if result is already a FileOperation
            if isinstance(result, FileOperation):
                return result
            return FileOperation(success=True, result=result)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error in {func.__name__}: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)
            return FileOperation(success=False, error_message=str(e))
    return wrapper
```

### Function Return Types
Modified the return behavior of specific functions to return raw values that get wrapped in FileOperation objects by the decorator:
- Fixed `rename_file()` to return a Path object directly
- Fixed `get_file_hash()` to return a dictionary directly

### Test Assertions
Updated test assertions to properly compare string representations of Path objects:
```python
# Before
assert result.result == new_path

# After
assert str(result.result) == str(new_path)
```

## Benefits of the Upgrade
1. **Better Performance**: Pydantic v2 is significantly faster than v1
2. **Improved Validation**: Stronger type checking catches more errors at runtime
3. **Future Compatibility**: Ensures the project works with modern Python libraries
4. **Better Documentation**: Updated docs provide clearer guidance for developers

## Future Considerations
- Monitor Pydantic version updates for any breaking changes
- Consider adding more type annotations throughout the codebase
- Explore additional Pydantic v2 features like computed fields
- Regular test maintenance to keep up with validation behavior changes
